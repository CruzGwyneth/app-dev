*The Gifted Series*
The Gifted is a Thai series about high school students who have supernatural abilities.
Their innate abilities were unlocked through an audio played during the entrance test.
Regular students cannot hear the audio but Gifted students will be able to.
The series follows a student named Pang, who is the only Gifted student who comes from the lowest class section.
The other Gifted students deem him unworthy of being Gifted since they see his academic skills as lacking.
As the story moves forward with Pang trying to prove his worth as a Gifted student, he discovers a much darker truth.
The school director, along with their class adviser, is hiding this truth from every Gifted class generation.
Eventually, Pang uncovers the truth about the Gifted class.
He gathers his fellow Gifted students on a mission to take down the director.
